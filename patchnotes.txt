  - Added AlgExplorer.bat, a user-friendly batch file
  - Added support for substitutions on algorithms with slice moves
  - Added parsing of input algorithms that handles cancellations (R U R' U' U R2 -> R U R)
  - Added flag -b: uses Chad Batten's evaluation scheme
  - Added flags -tl <ltrims> and -tr <rtrims>: trims movestypes in ltrims and rtrims from left and right of algorithms, respectively
  - Changed internal representation of algorithms and Markov model
      -> Faster substitutions and ranking
      -> Slower algorithm extraction and file output
  - Fixed bug with progress bars (now display 10 |'s regardless of input size)
  - Fixed bug with Python 3.x handling int division differently
  prompt user for ratings after collecting trainign data (to fill in low-information things)
  and rotations as premoves (alternate execution angles)
  commute moves
  rotations in the middle of moves (max n rotations)
  combine Rr', etc
  use a trie to represent algorithm lists? (sort a trie wrt evals...?) -> alglist class?
    as you eavluate the trie, add to heap -> linearithmic
    evaluateone in analyzer - takes prior key, new move, returns (eval, new key)
  analyzer.analyze(alglist trie)?
    generators? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/231767/what-does-the-yield-keyword-do-in-python
  ??? scoring system no longer normalizes by algorithm length
  ??? handle non-ce algs (with parens)
  ??? factor out progress bar code?
  ??? compile to executable
  autoupdater?
